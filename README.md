### 👾 About
Hi — I build stuff that brings people together.  
I care about **open infrastructure, resilient systems, and strong communities**. Crypto is a way to coordinate energy, creativity, and value.

### 💡 Vision
Build meaningful tools and spaces that survive markets and amplify humans.

- 🌍 Explore layers of the decentralized web  
- 🔑 Design thoughtful on-chain primitives and UX  
- 🥕 Grow friendly, inclusive communities that last  
- ⚙️ Automate boring ops so people can create more  
- 💬 Share learnings, docs, and practical tooling

### 🧠 Tech Playground
> stack = ["Node.js", "Python", "Rust", "Solidity", "Docker", "Web3.js"]  
> infra = ["RPC networks", "Layer-2s", "Decentralized storage", "CI/CD"]  
> focus = ["smart contracts", "developer tools", "community infra"]

### ⚡ Current Work
🧩 running validator nodes & monitoring infra  
🔗 building cross-chain experiments & integrations  
📡 deploying reliable RPC & service stacks  
📚 documenting workflows, creating onboarding guides

### 📦 Principles
- Open by default — prefer permissive licenses and public tooling.  
- Small, iterative releases — ship often, learn fast.  
- Devops-friendly — reproducible infra and clear runbooks.  
- Community-first — reward contributors, write clear docs.
